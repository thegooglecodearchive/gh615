# Introduction #

Only one months or so after getting my gh615, my datacable started to look like this, but it was still functioning:

Some time later I could not establish a connection anymore, so I emailed Globalsat Taiwan about getting a replacement. A couple of weeks went by without receiving an answer, so I resend the email to Globalsat US asking the favor of forwarding it to someone in charge in Taiwan. (Globalsat US was not responsible since I purchased the unit in Europe) Almost instantly someone at Globalsat US replied saying I would be contacted by Globalsat Taiwan the next day, which was indeed so. I was told, that the problem was most likely the watch itself, and not the cable, which seemed highly unlikely to me, and that I should return the entire unit to my dealer.

Not very satisfied with the answer I decided to talk to my dealer who in return send my just a new datacable. Voil√† , everything works fine again.
